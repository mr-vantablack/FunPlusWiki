# Blacklist
If some player is bothering you and you want to permanently ban him from joining your rooms, then just enter his nickname in the blacklist. 
The file is located in the directory `Mods/FunPlusEssentials/blacklist.txt` 

Each nickname must be written from a new line, an example:

		nothacker23
		script_kiddie2008
		MaskedKiller666
